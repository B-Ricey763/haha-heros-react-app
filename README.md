# Introduction 
Hello, thank you for showing your interest in Bits of Good! This semester, we are focusing our recruitment on the practical skills of developers through this assessment! We hope you enjoy the task and if you have any questions or if any part is ambiguous, please file a GitHub issue on the repository with whichever task number (i.e. 0,1,2,3, etc.) you are working on!

While this assessment comes in various levels (Setup --> Expert), we do not expect you to be able to complete all of the levels; we just want to see your thought process and how you write and organize code. Additionally, we have provided a sample `create-react-app` boilerplate but feel free to use a different framework or customize this repository to your needs (i.e. install any extra libraries, etc. you need). Our only requirement is that you use React, Typescript, and at most one component library (if you choose to use one).

Because this assessment is very open ended, there are many ways to do the tasks so for most of the tasks, there is no right or wrong way to do things.

To submit your project, please commit your code to Github (preferred) or another version control platform and share a link to your repository in our application.

Once again, we would like to emphasize this take home assessment is designed to be challenging and we do not expect you to be able to do the entire thing (but of course, try your best to complete as much as possible!)
